### Face Recognition 

This repository contains research on face detection and face recognition algorithms.

* Face Detection

    Face Detection is required crop the face region of an image before running face recognition algorithm. For this task 4 experiments were perfomed

    * cvlib
    * dlib CNN
    * dlib HOG
    * Ultra-lightweight face detection model (https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB)
